	<h1>Hi, I'm Alex. Here are a couple of things about me:</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>I bake bread, and I hate to be a hipster about it, but I was doing it in the prime window between when Chad Robertson and Liz Pruitt made it cool and when SF techbros started picking it up. <a href="pictures/bread.html">See some pictures here</li></a><br>
		<li>I like to walk around the city without headphones on, and if I need to look at my phone, I stop walking and stand off to the side. I think we'd all be better off if we left ourselves open to the city more</li><br>
		<li>Here are some books that I'm currently reading (explanation of my weird system for reading books to come)</li><br>
		<li>I organize a ~monthly bakery run to various bakeries around SF. It's inclusive (or at least I try my best to make sure we're acting inclusively) and (my aim is to) keep us in touch with a very important part of the community</li><br>
		<li>Sometimes I take <a href="/pictures/photography.html">pictures</a>. My memory is bad, and photos are a way for me to capture the feelings, the smells, the sounds, the words of things we've done</li><br>
		<li>Things that I love: <u>dogs</u> (the lifeprotip for petting dogs is to walk up to a dog owner, hands behind your back, lean in slightly, and say the exact words "may I pet your dog?" Don't be offended if they say no, it's probably for a good reason). <u>Dutch Bros</u>. <u>Sales on socks</u>. <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvpQ8e6UHY">煎饼馃子</a></u> (the kind with 油条, NOT that imposter kind with Chinese tortilla chips). <u>The Outer Richmond</u>.</li>
	</ul>
