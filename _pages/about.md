I'm Alex

I primarily work as a Product Manager. I slot between Product, BA, and Ops. I write about Product Management, and how PMs have unique leverage on the workplace happiness of their teammates

As a hobby, I do food photography. I take photos for restaurants that balance "professional obviously staged and clearly-not-representative-of-the-median-experience" and "shitty camera phone flash I-hope-this-isn't-the-median-experience". Email me at dou.alexander@gmail.com if you know anyone who would be interested
