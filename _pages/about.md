I'm Alex



I primarily work as a Product Manager. Historically, I've flitted between Product, Business Analyst, and Ops roles. I write about Product Management, and how PMs have unique leverage on the workplace happiness of their teammates



Current state of this site:



* This is designed as an air-lock between me and the world

* The term "air-lock" is chosen intentionally because it's a stopping point between two atmospheres to equalize pressure

* My research, believes, and biases—all in their various and assorted states—represent one atmosphere. Any potential reader's will represent another. My [writing](https://alexanderdou.com/) should allow us an opportunity to equilibrate before interacting deeply
