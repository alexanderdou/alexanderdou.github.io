# Moved this page to a custom subdomain at alexanderdou.com

* Steps taken to do this:

  * Using the [help article here ](https://help.github.com/en/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain) to add a new custom domain on the Github side

  * Get confused when alexanderdou.github.io goes to an Squarespace page

  * Change ANAME and CNAME records on the DNS to stop pointing to the expired Squarespace membership and instead back to alexanderdou.github.io

  * Wait to see if that works. The hypothesis is that alexanderdou.com will now redirect to alexanderdou.github.com

* Things learned:

  * ANAME and CNAME point a host name to a different DNS record via IP and name, respectively. [Small explanation here](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/differences-a-cname-records/)

  

# Thoughts from today:

* Doing Lambda School for development would be cool. I know that a weakness of mine is unstructured learning, but I do do well in an environment where there's 1) fast and focused feedback and 2) live people to talk out concepts with and shape my mental map (examples from the past: two-month plan, frequent check-ins with Jesse, spec template)

  * Things to check in before going down that route: what are typical job prospects out of a program like Lambda School? What are interviews for Engineering like? I've there's a lot of whiteboarding and exercises (e.g. Fizzbuzz) and take home projects, as well as obscure knowledge and data structures and algorithms. Will Lambda School prepare me for that? If not, do I want to sign up for that?

  * Another thing to think about: why engineering? There are definitely things I've wanted to build that I ended up topping out on, technically, so maybe for that? It also feels like with reading about initiatives like the USDS, there is a lot that can be done to help the world via engineering. 

  

# Things to look into tomorrow:

* Check to see if the custom domain thing has changed. The goal is to be able to see this blog content on alexanderdou.com

* Look into the question: What are alternatives to Jekyll? Are there any that would be more or less suited to what I want to make?

* Begin thinking: what I want this site to be: photos? CV? Blog page? Is there a way to make it all three? Think "your home on the Internet" from Roosterteeth
