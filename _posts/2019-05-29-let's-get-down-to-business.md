I have most of the pieces in place. I have a:
* Github Page (personal version)
* Custom domain- alexanderdou.com
* Jekyll running locally so that I can build and test locally

The workflow looks like:
1. Clone repo using the link on the project page
2. Make changes to the layout files that have been cloned to my computer
3. Test using the `jekyll serve` command
4. Repeat Steps 2-3 until I see the changes that I like
5. Add and commit with `git add .` and `git commit`
6. Push with `git push`
* If I fuck up irreperably along the way, just delete the files and re-clone from Step 1
