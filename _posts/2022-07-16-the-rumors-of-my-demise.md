title: The rumors of my demise

date: 2022-07-16

The main reason I've gone this long without writing is because I couldn't `bundle exec jekyll serve` and test what the post would look like on my localhost



That kicked off a whole set of linked-but-separate frictions: 



* When I posted images or any sort of formatting, I would have to deploy and load it on the internet

* That increased the time it took me to post

* That made it less likely I would be able to fit a writing + posting session in in my day

* Hence, no posts coming to the blog

My wife is gone for 2 weeks, on work training, and so 1 week into my home isolation, I finally ran out of things to distract myself with. That led to:



* Spinning up a bunch of tabs

* Reading more backlogged articles in Pocket for longer sustained duration

* Revisiting more backlogged Drafts in Notion

* Realizing that I hadn't posted in a long time

* Sitting down and googling "why can't I `bundle exec jekyll serve`"

* Updating ruby (and running into an error)  

* Installing rvm

* Updating ruby take 2

* Success!

**Overall**, I have two takeaways:



1. Unstructured [Slack](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/slack/) time can result in lots of Outcome

2. You need to give yourself more Slack time than you thought
