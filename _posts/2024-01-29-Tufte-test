does new line in MD just turn into a linebreak without me having to <br>?

let's try headers:
# Here's an H1
## Here's an H2
### I would expect each of these to be on a new line
And I would expect this to be on a new line too

### How about lists?
* Here's item one
	* This should be indented -> 
	* So shoudl this -> 
* But this should be on the first line

### Now here's the big test: sidenotes
This should invoke a sidenote <span class="sidenote-number"></span>
<span class="sidenote">And this should show up in the side.</span>


This should display another one too<span class="sidenote-number"></span>
<span class="sidenote">This one should also show up in the side.</span>
