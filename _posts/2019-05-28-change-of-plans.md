Yesterday, [I blocked myself](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/congratulations-you-played-yourself). I created a new branch to house the attempt to replicate the [Minimal theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal). However, I found myself committing changes and refreshing the URL to no avail. It took me longer than I'd like to admit to realize the reason why: I was making changes on the branch, and Jekyll builds from master.

As best I can understand, there's no way to build locally without learning how to use Git / Github from the command line. I thought this would be a step a couple of projects down the line, but I believe that I'm going to have to learn this before I can move on.

Tasks:
* Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) on how to set up GitHub to run locally
* Learn how to build locally
* Learn how to deploy and merge (I think this is where Pull Requests come in to play) when I'm satistied with the local build
* My developer roommate also told me about "gulp" and that there's a wide world of web developer build tools, so do some research on the surface area of that world

Things I learned today:
* How to get out of vi. I think that's enough for today.
