title: So you think you can learn how to dance

I've been learning how to dance in quarantine. 

There's no better time to pick up [arbitrary, unexpected skills](https://lifehacker.com/teach-yourself-an-arbitrary-skill-during-social-distanc-1844533192). I've also been flirting with the dangerous idea that work isn't everything in life, so I'm dedicating some time to amassing more [strange skills](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexdou/). 

Here's my routine:
* 5 minutes- Refresh with [this video by Shuffle Dance Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfM49r6gX0g)
* 15 minutes- Practice the three basic shuffle moves from the above video with a [metronome](https://www.sessiontown.com/en/music-games-apps/free-online-metronome-app). Work up from 95 bpm to as high as you can maintain form. Focus on transitioning smoothly between the three moves
* 10 minutes- Practice those three basic shuffle moves with actual songs. There's an excellent [100 bpm Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5JpANhLlGcgZcLFcrNhL7j?si=X21XW0XnQoSUZhBbw6ObHA) that fits this purpose quite well
* 10 mintues- try some actual choreography. I adore fun Asian guys (natch) with smiles that light up rooms, so I follow Eunho Kim and Junsun Yoo from 1Million Dance Studio. Here's a [rambunctious and delightful choreography to My House by Flo Rida](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f79Vr-pCdow). I love how his intro is him pretending to come into someone's house for the first time
* Every 2-3 sessions record on video and watch back afterward. The goal here is to learn as best I can with my body *feeling* the moves, then record and watch it and try to associate how my *feeling* of the moves correlates with how the moves actually *look*. Then, find diffs between look and feel, and try to incorporate it again with the body


This routine will likely change, but the core of this learning routine is:
* [Deliberate Practice](https://commoncog.com/blog/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you/#dodeliberatepractice)- practicing the basic moves at the edge of my ability, then ratcheting the speed back down helps to feel comfortable
* Keep It Fun- the second this becomes drudge or I become self-conscious, I know I'm going to abandon it
* [Employ Double-Loop Learning](http://pds8.egloos.com/pds/200805/20/87/chris_argyris_learning.pdf)- in normal learning this refers to getting an outside system to be able to validate your progress and learning against. This could be a lab buddy, a professional coach, or a chess algorithm. The important thing is that it's not just you judging your own progress. In dancing this tends to be mirrors in the studio, and I puzzled for a while on how to set up a live camera feed so I could watch myself in HD as I danced with minimal lag. But then I realized a simple "try-watch-try" is sufficient for the level of dance I want to get to
