# Do things that don't scale

So goes the (new) age-old advice from VC Yoda, Paul Graham. After him, the deluge of startups transforming unsexy industries that, historically, don't scale: [Law](https://www.atrium.co/); [Container ships](http://flexport.com/) (and [containers!](https://docker.com)—just kidding these definitely scale); [Health Insurance](https://www.zenefits.com/) (disclaimer: I used to work here); [Home Buying](https://www.opendoor.com/); Oh—[and also Home Buying](https://www.homelight.com/); and, last but not least, [Home Buying](https://www.knock.com/).

One unsexy industry that I want to focus on is personal storage, specifically one emerging front runner called [Clutter](https://www.clutter.com). 

Here are some basic facts about Clutter:
* Clutter offers cheap storage units for stuff that doesn't fit into your home
* Clutter also offers free pickup and delivery when you want to put more stuff in or take it out
* Clutter [has raised nearly $300M, after their latest $200M Series D, led by SoftBank](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/clutter)
* Clutter has absorbed a couple of competitors in the space: [Omni and Handy](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/17/clutter-has-picked-up-omnis-storage-business-omni-to-focus-on-rentals/)
* Clutter operates in [10 locations](https://www.clutter.com/locations) (technically, 3 of them are _relatively_ close: LA, Orange County, and Inland Empire; but they still break them out as separate regions on the website)

By most standards, Clutter is killing it, and the trades seem to agree.

# Diving into the Clutter

There's a book called Chaos Monkeys by Antonio García Martínez. It's an entertaining enough book, but something that stuck with me was this passage:

> When confronted with any startup idea, ask yourself one simple question: How many miracles have to happen for this to succeed?
> If the answer is zero, you're not looking at a startup, you're just dealing with a regular business like a laundry or a trucking business.
> To be a startup, miracles need to happen. But a precise number of miracles. Most successful startups depend on one miracle only. 
> The classic sign of a shitty startup idea is that it requires at least two (or more!) miracles to succeed. 

I'm not saying that Clutter is a shitty startup idea. But, I do believe it will take more than one miracle to succeed. Some ideas just based off of a cursory dive into the business:
* They need users to pay for long enough to pay off their CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost). _This is a user retention miracle_
* They need users to take it easy on checking in and checking out items, because that incurs costs to the company (Cost of Revenue). _This is a variable cost/user behavior miracle_
* They need to build an order/warehousing management system that can easily find everything a given customer has checked in. _This is a technological miracle (one that Amazon is working on, as it happens)_
* They need deliveries and pickups to be as efficient as possible. _This is a process miracle_
* They need their warehouses to not burn down, flood, or be hit by an earthquake. _This is a literal miracle_

I'd like to spend the next couple of weeks digging into this.
