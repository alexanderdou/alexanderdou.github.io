# Been a while



In the past few days I had:

* EDGE- more on that in another blog post

* A sickness that I picked up from sleeping with the windows open and insufficient blanket coverage

* Heat wave in SF :(



So we're back at the blog. I've decided that the goal of learning HTML and CSS sufficiently to recreate the Minimal theme is just not going to happen in a realistic time frame: I'm looking for jobs and I've linked to this site in a couple of places. So here's the new plan:



1. Add the theme

2. Make the site pretty

3. Keep learning HTML and CSS in the meantime
