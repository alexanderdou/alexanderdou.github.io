title: User Interviewing is (not that) hard

date: 2021-10-20

When I started at the current role, I brought in a lot of steam from Mode to talk to a user every day. Looming large in my memory was a conversation with my manager where I was telling him about a wonderful conversation I had with a user, and I said, "Why don't we do this more often?" And he said, cryptically, "Yeah, why *don't* we?"  



I think that emphasis is in the right place: why *don't* we talk to users every day? 



We might not because:



- Account Management owns the relationship to the customer, and we can't go around them

- We can't get [Support Tool] access because a full agent seat costs $X per month

- It's time-consuming and costly to perform the scheduling logistics



Observing myself and PMs at the current role, I think those are all dissemblances. I think it boils down to two things:



1. It's hard to be vulnerable and I'm scared of what I'm going to hear

2. I am overloaded and can't send out emails and schedule meetings with users







(2) is the easier one to solve: you can buy tools (e.g. [Dovetail](https://dovetailapp.com/), [Sprig (n√©e UserLeap)](https://sprig.com/), [UserFlow](https://userflow.com/user-onboarding-software)) or you can hire a person (in the "[Things You're Allowed to Do](https://milan.cvitkovic.net/writing/things_youre_allowed_to_do/)" sense)



(1) is the limiting reagent and the one that Product Teams have to really face
