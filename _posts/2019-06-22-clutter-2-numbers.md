title: "Dissecting Startups- Clutter Pile 2: Numbers"

date: 2019-06-27

[Last post](https://alexanderdou.com/blog/2019/06/22/clutter-1-financials), we delved into Clutter's hypothetical financial levers: Revenue and Cost drivers, specifically Monthly Subscription Revenue and CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), respectively. I believe those are the biggest factors that Clutter has available to pull.



This post, I want to actually try to ballpark some numbers and put together a picture of what their business model might look like. Again, with this come disclaimers:

* I am not a financial expert, nor do I have any specific knowledge of Clutter's financials

* I'm pulling only from publicly available sources of data



# Digging into Costs

This is tricky. We went over a couple of categories last time though, and let's build from there.



## Operating Costs

* Warehouse rent- this is rented based on the Square Footage used, along with an estimated operating expense (aka NNN), so if your base rate is $.90 SQFT/Mo and $.20 NNN/Mo, you're going to pay $1.10 per Square Foot per Month. This also means that as the company's user base grows, so too do their storage costs

	* This, of course, may change if Clutter owns their warehouse spaces. This becomes a fixed cost instead of a variable cost, and this model overestimates the true cost

	* This model also may underestimate the true cost by not accounting for insurance to protect users' belongings. However, it doesn't seem like the cost would be much, as Clutter's basic [Security Warranty Policy](https://www.clutter.com/legal/limited_security_warranty) promises a payout of $1.00 per pound in aggregate per user up to a maximum of $1000 (so your [$1500 LG OLED TV will be paid out $57](https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-65EF9500-oled-4k-tv))

* Cost of Delivery / Pickup for existing customers (aka Input / Output or I/O)- customers can request items be delivered to them from their storage unit or additional items be added to their storage. This will be a function of Labor and Distance driven. Based on Warehouse Lead and Associate job postings on their [Careers page](https://www.fountain.com/c/clutter/clutter/US#/), it looks like the company has warehouses in:

	* Tracy, CA (servicing the Bay Area)

	* Des Moines, WA (servicing Seattle)

	* North Bergen, NJ (servicing NYC)

	* Monroe, NJ (servicing NJ)

	* Franklin Park, IL (servicing Chicago)

So they are never too far away from their markets

	* This cost is particularly dangerous to Clutter, because high I/O will incur insane cost without additional revenue to offset it. If, say, a user is using this twice a month and expecting delivery within a few days, that will probably tip that user into unprofitability

* First-time pickup- customers will get completely free pickup. The cost here come from the same sources as the previous item: Labor and Distance driven

* Wages- pretty straight forward math here: just multiple the average salary and number of HQ employees, and do a similar calculation for hourly Warehouse employees 

* CAC- let's leave this as a question mark for now, because the other numbers will show us how much budget is left for Marketing to play with



# Estimating Revenue

This part is pretty easy. Revenue comes from two places for Clutter:

* Monthly subscriptions- I pulled some numbers from their website price preview and stored them [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18R1mVVr0hOpdOkQFt_Us_KlKwg46ZOMJIhiXSXyWDu4/edit?usp=sharing). Some observations:

	* More expensive regions = more expensive subscriptions

	* In the second tab, you can see by ZIP Code for the Los Angeles area. If we assume the warehouse is in Fontana, CA (based on a job post for a Warehouse Lead in Fontana), we can see that they also increase prices by distance from warehouse

* Inconvenience fees- these are fees assessed in case you make an appointment and miss it. In the grand scheme of things, they are negligible, but they do serve to offset wasted I/O trips
