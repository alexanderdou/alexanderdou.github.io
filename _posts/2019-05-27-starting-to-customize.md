Today I want to try to dig into the HTML and CSS to:
* Implement a new theme
* Make the CV page a little prettier

To do that, I'm using the [stock Jekyll themes supported by Github, located here](https://pages.github.com/themes/). The rough plan over the next few days is to replicate one of the themes as best I can, and then compare, similarly to the [Benjamin Franklin method of improving writing (located about 3/4 of the way down this article)](https://fs.blog/2012/07/what-is-deliberate-practice/)
