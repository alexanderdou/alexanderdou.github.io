Today I want to try to dig into the HTML and CSS to:
* Implement a new theme
* Make the CV page a little prettier

To do that, I'm using the [stock Jekyll themes supported by Github, located here](https://pages.github.com/themes/). The rough plan over the next few days is to replicate one of the themes as best I can, and then compare, similarly to the [Benjamin Franklin method of improving writing (located about 3/4 of the way down this article)](https://fs.blog/2012/07/what-is-deliberate-practice/)

1. Choose a theme. [Minimal](https://pages-themes.github.io/minimal/) looks really nice
2. Break down the elements that I'm going to have to build:
  * Sidebar / main content ![gif here](/assets/images/Kapture%202019-05-27%20at%2013.10.07.gif)
  * Font styles
    * Specifically around ul items: looks like they're currently styled with Times ![screenshot here](/assets/images/Screen%20Shot%202019-05-27%20at%201.14.55%20PM.png)
  * Treating images (a little outside the scope here, but important, as the images above are a little large and distracting)
3. Are there any pages that this theme will clash with?
  * Home- I don't think so
  * About- I don't think so
  * CV- Not clash, but compressing the main content into half the page will likely crowd the CV content
  * Blog- I don't think so
