title: "Simple (but not Easy) Checklist for Product Team Diagnosis"

When I come across a new Product Team, I have developed a Checklist of questions to run through. Please let me [know](https://www.admonymous.co/alexdou) if you have developed any that I should add

### Top 2 Questions:
- Is the team consistently solving Real Problems for large enough groups of Real People?
- Is solving those Problems resulting in money coming in the door? Enough to build a lasting business? 

### Validate with other teams:
- Is the Product (or Service) sell-able? <span class="sidenote-number"></span>  
<span class="sidenote">I recommend talking to SDRs and AEs to validate this</span>

- Is it Marketed effectively? Is it Positioned well? Does that Positioning stand out? Does [it diverge sufficiently from the other pitches out there](https://arc.net/l/quote/ddcyjfkg)?

- Is it easy to use and understand? Or are there negative externalities to confusing UX/UI that are being borne by other teams like Support and CSM? And are there effective channels of feedback between those teams and the PMs on your team?

### When you return your focus to your team, how are the following health markers:
- Can the team disagree well and debate productively?
- How do decisions happen on the 4 quadrant chart of Speed: Slow-Fast and Correctness: Right-Wrong? Are there individual Product Teams who tend to be Fast+Right more often than others?
- Is the team confident? How well-earned is that confidence?
- Does your team talk to Users in a sustainable, regular way?
- If you asked 5 random people across the team, would different folks' summary of the Vision and Strategy "rhyme"?
- Are you regularly doing 1:1s that aren't just status updates?
- Is there a Standard? Have you done the hard work of creating an artifact that you believe to be the baseline habits that undergird Product performance?
    - e.g. Talk to at least 1 User per week
    - All meetings have Agendas + all decisions are logged in a centralized notes doc
    - There is a feedback mechanism that everyone adheres to: e.g. Retro; What do I intend to do + EOW lookback; OKRs
