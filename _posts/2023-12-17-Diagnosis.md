- Are we, as a team, consistently solving Real Problems for large groups of Real People?
- Is that resulting in money coming in the door? Enough to build a lasting business? Enough to grow?
- Without going outside of your Zone of Competence:
    - Is the Product (or Service) sell-able?
    - Is it Marketed effectively? Is it Positioned well? Does that Positioning stand out? Does [it diverge sufficiently from the other pitches out there](https://arc.net/l/quote/ddcyjfkg)?
    - Is it easy to use and understand? Or are there negative externalities to confusing UX/UI that are being borne by other teams like Support and CSM? And are there effective channels of feedback between those teams and the PMs on your team?
- When you focus on your team, how are the following health markers:
    - Can the team disagree well and debate productively?
    - How do decisions happen on the 4 quadrant chart of Speed: Slow-Fast and Correctness: Right-Wrong? Are there individual Product Teams who tend to be Fast+Right more often than others?
    - Is the team confident? How well-earned is that confidence?
    - Does your team talk to Users in a sustainable, regular way?
    - Is there a story that unifies your team? Do they all have their own little stories within the broader story?
    - If you asked 5 random people across the team, would different folks' summary of the Vision and Strategy match up?
    - Are you doing 1:1s regularly, that aren't just status updates? Are they driven by your Direct Reports?
    - Is there a Standard? Have you done the hard work of creating an artifact that you believe to be the baseline habits that undergird Product performance?
        - e.g. Talk to at least 1 User per week
        - All meetings have Agendas + all decisions are logged in a centralized notes doc
        - There is a feedback mechanism that everyone adheres to: e.g. Retro; What do I intend to do + EOW lookback; OKRs
