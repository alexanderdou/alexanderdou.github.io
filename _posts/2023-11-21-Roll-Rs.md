## Day 2 progress: no rolled R's yet, but a new potato 
- 20 min
    - go through the [potato hand video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9mMvuRGKY8)
        - Still stuck on step 2, which is Lips + Tongue
        - I feel like I’m wedging the tip of my tongue in between my teeth and upper lip, which then makes my tongue have to flex and be stiff, which is the opposite of what all the tips say, which is to *relax the tongue*, so I have a question in my head of how to square that circle
        - I did find the *sequel:* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gOZTXqgKcY
    - I found a [new video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfMadRajLPg) that had the following steps:
        - don’t try to start with a Spanish word, instead try to isolate the sound
        - try to isolate the “tap”, with the “ara” sound (which is more like the “ata”/”ada” in catalogue or ladder)
            - As an aside, this links up with a tip from my friend to try to remove any association with the English “r”, and in response to my Day 1 recording of Rosa, it almost sounded like he was saying “hhhhhlr(rolled r)-osa”, so this might be a good video/technique to practice
- Still no results today, but I did get 30 minutes of practice in, as well as finding a new technique to try to practice
