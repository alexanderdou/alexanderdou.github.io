title: "[WIP] List of AI/LLM workflows that are useful"

date: 2023-07-24

_Context: I work in healthcare, where the LLM revolution eats up a lot of daily news airtime, but I haven't yet found any coherent AND confident takes on how LLM technology will change healthcare. However, I am convinced that if you're not thinking about this, you will get left behind by those who are, so this list is an ongoing list to try and compile them as I find them, and hopefully remix them_

**LLM that reads through Slack and can tell which conversations are relevant to your interests; it summarizes them for you if it's longer than 5 replies**



* Alternatively, it tells you that it's safe to ignore this message

* Some categories of alert:

    * Decision needs to be made

    * Action Item discussed in the thread but there is no owner or date for the Action Item

    * News article discussion-meaningful insights were distilled during the conversation





**Find and summarize the ‚Äúbest‚Äù Youtube content out there**

* There are so many Youtube channels out there nowadays and as average video length increases there's no time to watch them all. An LLM can indicate which ones are of most interest to you and pull out which snippets are the most important for you to watch



**pull URLs out of an image**

* This one's pretty self explanatory, but I found [this list of music sites on Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MXXBP6e.jpeg), and I didn't want to type everything out manually

[Union Square Ventures is experimenting with an AI assistant to record its internal conversations](https://twitter.com/usv/status/1786458897957404712)



This is one of my dreams: an always-on meeting recording tool that helps to automatically summarize and callback ideas. This is a high-leverage thing that I do for my Product Pods now (multiple folks have commented on my ability to facilitate and note-take at the same time, and how the act clears up action items and paves paths forward for the team) and I would love to hand that brain activity off to an assistant

[Roundup of 20 ways people are using GPTs from Lenny's Newsletter](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/you-should-be-playing-with-gpts-at?r=th9d)



A couple notable ones:

* **1- Train a GPT with writing + brand guidelines so Engineers and Designers can refine Copy**. PMMs and writers should be on the lookout‚Äîone way to interpret this is as a threat. Another way is to think of it as creating leverage by sidestepping time-consuming and neverending copy requests. PMs should also note how this can obviate a frequent time-consuming roundabout of copy review

* **4- Create a source of truth for product requirements**. I'm not 100% sure about this one. As the kids say, "big if true". I'm curious about 1) hallucinations and 2) how to handle "¬±XYZ requirement for scope based on feasibility investigations and more user research"

* **5- Figure out internal ownership and technical dependencies**. HUUUUUUGEEEEE. I would love a "git blame" for PMs, Designers, PMMs, Marketing folks, Sales, etc. Smart routing would be great. If it could get smart and proactively ping, "hey, XYZ convo is brewing over here in the Org", that could be a game-changer for cross-org comms

* **17- Draft release notes**. YES. At past roles that would take an entire half-day across the team, and quality + conciseness would swing wildly based on each PM's writing skill

    * Having the GPT field + parse inbound questions from the release notes would also be awesome

Maybe this provides a path toward writing memos or PRDs, given sufficient priming with your own raw notes about the strategy that you are pursuing

Catch up context on interminable email/Jira comment chains that you get tagged into ([source here](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/ai-can-do-my-email-now))



Sort of a digital Chief of Staff: here are the important conversations you missed out on in Slack; you are needed to make a decision‚Äîhere are the relevant points compiled into a memo for you; etc ([source: 24:27 on this episode of Lenny Podcast](https://www.lennyspodcast.com/the-10-traits-of-great-pms-how-ai-will-impact-your-product-and-slacks-product-development-process/#transcript))

If you get stuck on a memo or email, immediately outsource it to AI to get your momentum back up (I've been using [Lex](https://lex.page/)). It's easier to edit something already on the page than overcoming the blank page‚Äîthis tool can help you break through writer's block
