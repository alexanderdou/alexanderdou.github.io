_Context: I work in healthcare, where the LLM revolution eats up a lot of daily news airtime, but I haven't yet found any coherent AND confident takes on how LLM technology will change healthcare. However, I am convinced that if you're not thinking about this, you will get left behind by those who are, so this list is an ongoing list to try and compile them as I find them, and hopefully remix them_

# Evergreen list of potential ideas that draw from the next sectionüëáüèΩ
**LLM that reads through Slack and can tell which conversations are relevant to your interests; it summarizes them for you if it's longer than 5 replies**

* Alternatively, it tells you that it's safe to ignore this message
* Some categories of alert:
    * Decision needs to be made
    * Action Item discussed in the thread but there is no owner or date for the Action Item
    * News article discussion-meaningful insights were distilled during the conversation


**Find and summarize the ‚Äúbest‚Äù Youtube content out there**
* There are so many Youtube channels out there nowadays and as average video length increases there's no time to watch them all. An LLM can indicate which ones are of most interest to you and pull out which snippets are the most important for you to watch

If you get stuck on a memo or email, immediately outsource it to AI to get your momentum back up (I've been using [Lex](https://lex.page/)). It's easier to edit something already on the page than overcoming the blank page‚Äîthis tool can help you break through writer's block
