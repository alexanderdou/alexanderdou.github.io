If you're reading this, I've probably pointed you here to get a little better sense of how I work and think of the worldâ€”likely in a job-hunting context. Here is my [Working With Me Doc](https://alexdou.notion.site/Working-with-Alex-handbook-a4d4271cc39c46579bc98abf84b89e48?pvs=4)

In <a href="/Articles">Articles</a>, I write about: Product teardowns; Generalizeable patterns gathered from my PM work and PM coaching; Medium-conviction beliefs about how to set up and maintain high-performance teams 


A note on the <a href = "https://github.com/bradleytaunt/ET-Jekyll">ET (Edward Tufte) CSS theme</a> that I use: I tend to use lots of parantheticals when I talk and write. I find that it helps me to communicate extra context and be precise when defining "Black Hole words"<span class="sidenote-number"></span>, which I believe makes communication more effective and less lossy
